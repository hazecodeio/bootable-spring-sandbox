    <!--
        Having separate Spring Contexts comes in handy when main interacting components need to:
            - Be contained within a structural design; architectural patter
            - Not interfere with each other, e.g.
                - Can't configure MVC controller in the same environment a REST controller is configured
                - Each has it's own Servlet, Configurations, Contexts, etc
    -->
